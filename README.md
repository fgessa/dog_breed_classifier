## Project Overview

This Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project is part of the AI Nanodegree supervised projects! Here, we learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, thecode will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, we were required to make important design decisions about the user experience for our app.  The goal was that by completing this lab, we'd be in a position to understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.

2. [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog_breed_classifier/lfw`. 

3. [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog_breed_classifier/bottleneck_features`.

### Dependecies

I assume you have a deep learning environment already set up ie., you have tensflow, keras, etc already installed on your local or cloud machine
